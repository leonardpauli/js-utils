# @leonardpauli/utils
*Personal JS utility library*

__NOTE, TODO:__
- *(unstable branch, WIP merging old with new)*
- *(only see this section + src)*
- clean up
- ensure browser + nodejs compatible
- prefer existing libs (eg. rambda + chalk + readline + koa + request/node-fetch + etc) (or not? goal is towards rim)
- (prefer existing libs when working with others, as community support etc) (though still, goal is towards rim)
- add testing + usage example + etc
- publish to npm? or always use through github?

__Usage:__
- `npm i @leonardpauli/utils`
- `import x from '@leonardpauli/utils/lib/y'`
- *(see `module/src/*` + `*.test.js` for examples)*
 
__Note:__
- use eg. `npm i ramda` for basic/fundamental FP helpers
- this repo is for more specific utils
